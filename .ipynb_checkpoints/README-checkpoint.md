## Beats Per Minute of Songs.
Welcome to the 2025 Kaggle Playground Series! As kaggle plan to continue in the spirit of previous playgrounds, providing interesting and approachable datasets for our community to practice their machine learning skills, and anticipate a competition each month. My goal of this competition is to predict a song's beats-per-minute.

**Predicting Beats Per Minute of Songs.**

## Problem definition: 
How well can we predict the Beats-per-Minute of Songs, is the real life problem i am trying to solve.
## The Goal:
The goal of this competition is to predict a song's beats-per-minute.
## Data:
The data is downloaded from the kaggle for playground-series-s5e9: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s5e9/data
## Approach: ML models:
RandomForestRegressor, GradientBoostingRegressor, XGBOOST
## Submission
For each id in the test set, must predict a continuous-valued BeatsPerMinute. The file should contain a header 
## Features: 
This project stimulates music beats accross variouse matrics,including:id, RhythmScore, AudioLoudness, VocalContent, AcousticQuality,
InstrumentalScore, LivePerformanceLikelihood, MoodScore,
TrackDurationMs, Energy                   

## Evaluation:
The evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSE (root mean squared error).
Submissions are evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error between the predicted and the observed target.
